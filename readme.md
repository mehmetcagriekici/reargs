# ReArgs

**ReArgs (not ‚Äúregards‚Äù)** is a command-line Python application that analyzes `.txt` files for semantic repetitions and similarities.
It does **not** rewrite your text for you‚Äîit simply helps you **visualize and organize** your writing by highlighting repetitions and grouping similar content.

## ‚ú® Motivation

I enjoy writing posts and articles (often on Reddit), but I noticed a recurring problem:
my drafts quickly turned into a mess because of poor planning and constant repetition.

Reading an entire article multiple times to catch repetitions was frustrating, so I built **ReArgs** to automatically surface these similarities.
It helps me:

* Write **cleaner articles** by avoiding unintentional repetition.
* **Understand other articles** better by grouping sentences and paragraphs with similar meaning.

## üöÄ How to Use

Run the provided shell script with a `.txt` file as an argument:

```bash
./run.sh path/to/article.txt
```

### Notes

* The application only accepts **one `.txt` file at a time**.
* Your original file is never modified.
* Results are displayed in the console and also written to the `output/` folder.
* The `transforms/` folder is used internally‚Äîdo not manually modify its contents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The application copies the input file into the `transforms/` folder.
2. It splits the article into **paragraphs** and **sentences**.
3. Using [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), it:

   * Finds semantic similarities within each paragraph.
   * Reduces repetitive sentences.
   * Then checks similarities **across the entire article**.

### Similarity Clusters

* **Hard clusters (‚â• 0.8 similarity):** treated as duplicates.
* **Soft clusters (0.6‚Äì0.8 similarity):** treated as sentences with close meaning.

The application reduces paragraphs accordingly, re-writes the intermediate file in `transforms/`, and keeps a detailed log of all operations.
Finally:

* A **similarity graph** and grouped results are printed to the console.
* A summary report is written to the `output/` folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è While the reduced article remains in the `transforms/` folder, it‚Äôs **not intended for direct use** as a new article.
The purpose is to highlight repetitions, not to automatically generate polished text.
