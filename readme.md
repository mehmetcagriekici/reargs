# ReArgs

**ReArgs (not “regards”)** is a tool to help you **re-polish** or better understand an article or text.  

It works by:  
- Grouping paragraphs in a text.  
- Checking each sentence within a paragraph and grouping them according to their meaning using [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers?tab=readme-ov-file).  
- Then grouping paragraphs in the same way.  

This allows you to:  
- Spot logic repetitions in your writing.  
- Reorganize your text to make it **clearer, more concise, and easier to read**.  
- Quickly see what an article or each paragraph is about.
