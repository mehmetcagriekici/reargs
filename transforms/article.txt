What is the Catholic Church’s Perspective on Some Fundamental Issues?

Hello, first of all, thank you to everyone reading this post. My goal is not to attack anyone’s faith or be disrespectful. I am genuinely seeking honest, straightforward propositions—without wordplay—that, if possible, are scientific, or if not, philosophical, logical, and lead to conclusions. I am constantly in an inner conflict, but my aim is not to find peace, it is to be convinced.

1) Existence and God – Is there meaning behind existence?

The first question religions generally present to me is: why does all this exist?
This question carries no cosmic significance for me. Plants perform photosynthesis; there is an explanation for us, but the plant just does it. When an apple falls from a tree, it is not aware of any reason; it only “exists” for us. Similarly, events in the universe just happen. We may not know how they happen, but by observing the existence around us, we can at least infer that none of this is conscious.

I see what I am saying not as an explanation or an answer, but merely as the first spark of an inference. All of this is also related to our thought model, and in an Aristotelian perspective, it is difficult to explain that existence “simply exists.” I do not mean this as criticism.

To make the above easier to understand before continuing, here is a quote from Democritus:

"By convention sweet is sweet, by convention bitter is bitter, by convention hot is hot, by convention cold is cold, by convention color is color. But in reality there are atoms and the void."

TL;DR: Meaning is not universal, it is personal. → First proposition

Secondly, I want to touch on existence itself. For me, everything comes from infinity and goes to infinity, and in this process, everything exists within infinity. Can I prove this? No. But I think this inference is more consistent than assuming existence is unique and has a beginning. Because if we consider existence as a unique/special being, then a “why” question emerges that we cannot answer. Again, an unanswerable “first cause” arises. But if we assume everything comes from infinity and goes to infinity, this whole process is just one of infinitely many processes, and there is no unanswerable problem left.

I want to add a short footnote here: the structure of the universe shows us it has a beginning, but when I say “everything,” I do not mean this specific universe. We always ask why the Big Bang happened, how it happened—I don’t know how it happened. (“Gravitons/gravitational waves/LIGO” are topics we do not yet understand but may one day.) But I have an answer to the “why”: there is none. Because if an infinite number of Big Bangs have happened infinitely, it produces a mix where everything can exist or not exist. Everything exists and does not exist “at the same time.” Then the whole matter is just a transformation, a flow. There is no “why” left. More importantly, regardless of how it happens, there is no place for consciousness/intelligence. In this case, believing in a god becomes extremely difficult. Because a god would require extra evidence, turning a sea of all possibilities into a single droplet, and then the problems of meaning and first cause reappear. Even if you claim that everything in the universe has a cause, then what is God’s cause?

TL;DR: All existence comes from infinity and goes to infinity; there is no beginning or end. → Second proposition

The last problem regarding religions explaining existence is whether there is a consciousness behind it. I have little to say here; unfortunately, this is not a proposition I can truly respect—though I try to. You can imagine something behind everything. But this claim really requires strong evidence. I have reached this inference through reason, it seems logical to me; calling it a matter of faith or a mystery would be, for me, nothing more than an escape. Still—trying to respect it—I will ask two questions to understand:

How can an infinite consciousness exist?
I do not want to go deeply into what consciousness is or how it forms, but briefly, consciousness is a product of the human brain. Different brain regions have different functions, and if these regions are damaged, you may experience issues like personality changes. In short, what makes you “you” is your brain—“Prefrontal Cortex, Limbic System, Default Mode Network, Thalamus, and Brainstem” all form a network that creates consciousness. So an infinite consciousness is not possible.

Evidence? — Really evidence?
Claiming there is a consciousness behind everything is a huge claim, and huge claims require huge evidence. Let’s say such a consciousness exists—how did it form? When did it decide to act? Now we also encounter a time problem. Is time independent of the universe? If so, how do you explain the relativity of time? Is time a constant? As in every explanation of god, a first-cause problem arises again, and in this case, also: why does this consciousness exist? If there is a consciousness behind everything, why does it exist?

TL;DR: There is no consciousness behind existence; whether existence has a beginning or not, consciousness is the result of existence, not its cause. → Third proposition

2) Why and How – We are hungry and there is food, we look for a cause and there is a cause.

3) Ethics and Religion – Are there universal moral rules? Did morality descend from the sky?

4) Religion and God – Are religions sacred?
